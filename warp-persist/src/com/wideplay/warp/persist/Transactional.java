 * Any method or class marked with this annotation will be considered for transactionality.
 * Consult the documentation on http://www.wideplay.com for detailed semantics.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *  Marking a method {@code @Transactional} will work with the default configuration as
 * expected. Any classes marked {@code @Transactional} will only work if you specify the
 * {@code forAll(Matchers.annotatedWith(Transactional.class), Matchers.any()} clause in your
 * warp-persist module configuration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Class level {@code @Transactional} allows you to specify transaction semantics for all
 * non-private methods in the class once at the top. You can optionally override it on a per-method
 * basis too. However, this means that classes not marked {@code @Transactional} but with
 * methods marked {@code @Transactional} will *not* be intercepted for transaction wrapping.
