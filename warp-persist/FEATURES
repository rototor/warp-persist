This is a cumulative list of features (after the basic integration).

- Method matcher now customizable for transactional methods (use spring's @Transactional if u like =), use .forAll(..) in builder
- Abstract classes + abstract methods can now be DynamicFinders (use .addAccessor on abstract classes)
- Plenty of tests for veracity of DF services, unit-of-work semantics etc.
- WorkManager added to define custom units-of-work (for example, using SPR strategy but doing work in background threads--outside a request)
- SPR filters tightened up to avoid leaks in case of exceptions/errors + tests
- @Transactional methods can now be nested safely; with the inner ones joining the enclosing transaction context silently
- Tests now run on ant build, plus tests against the distro jar have been added

- Read-only transactions support added for Hibernate (not supported by JPA local txns)
