This is a cumulative list of features (after the basic integration).

- Method matcher now customizable for transactional methods (use spring's @Transactional if u like =)
- Abstract classes + abstract methods can now be DynamicFinders
- Plenty of tests for veracity of DF services, unit-of-work semantics etc.
- WorkManager added to define custom units-of-work (for example, using SPR strategy but doing work in background threads)
- SPR filters tightened up to avoid leaks in case of exceptions/errors
